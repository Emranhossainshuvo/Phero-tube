                        var... var is the old way to declare a variable, many people use it today but most of the people use let or const instead of var. var is a function scoped variable declaration mathod. Where ever you declare a variable with the keyword var you can access to the variable from anywhere of the .js file but if you declare it in a function then you cannot access it from outside of the function. 
                        <br><br>
                        let... let keyword introduced in ES6 let is a local scoped variable keyword if you declare a variable with the deyword let in a block then you cannot access to the variable from the outside of that block. let variables are reassignable but not redeclarable. 
                        <br><br>
                        const... const is also introduced in ES6 is a method to declare a variable. A variable that was declared by the keyword const cannot be reassigned or redeclared. It's also a block scoped variable keyword

                        Null is normally means that there is no value in the thing you want to access it can be a variable or can be a array or object. On the other hand Undefined means that the value you're trying to acces isn't defined yet that means un-defined. Both Null and Undefined
                        are primitive data types of JavaScript. 
                        <br> <br>
                        Null use case: if I know that any data can be missing from user or from API then I will set a condition  that if the data is missing then I will set there null. 
                        <br> <br>
                        Undefined use case: While we set null for a value or data but we woun't set undefined intentionally for a data or value. Personally, I consider undefined as an error till now.

                    What do you mean by REST API?

                    <p>REST API is a way for two applications to communicate with each other using HTTP or HTTPS requests. Rest API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It uses HTTP or HTTPS methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to access and manipulate resources. REST API is also known as RESTful API. REST API is a set of architectural constraints for designing web services and it follows the principles of REST architecture. 
                        <br>REST API must adhere to 4 constraints:
